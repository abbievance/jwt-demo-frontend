# jwt-demo-frontend

Lots of demo code came from here: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-a-fullstack-authentication-system-with-react-express-mongodb-heroku-and-netlify/ This is a prototype for a frontend requesting from a backend authenticated with jwt. LOTS of this code (the majority) came from the demo linked above. The frontend is written using React (vite).

The corresponding backend demo can be found here: https://github.com/abbievance/jwt-demo-backend
